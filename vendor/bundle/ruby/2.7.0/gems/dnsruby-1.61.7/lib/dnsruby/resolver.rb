module Dnsruby
  #  == Description
  #  Dnsruby::Resolver is a DNS stub resolver.
  #  This class performs queries with retries across multiple nameservers.
  #  The system configured resolvers are used by default.
  #
  #  The retry policy is a combination of the Net::DNS and dnsjava approach, and has the option of :
  #  * A total timeout for the query (defaults to 0, meaning "no total timeout")
  #  * A retransmission system that targets the namervers concurrently once the first query round is
  #   complete, but in which the total time per query round is split between the number of nameservers
  #   targetted for the first round. and total time for query round is doubled for each query round
  #
  #  Note that, if a total timeout is specified, then that will apply regardless of the retry policy
  #  (i.e. it may cut retries short).
  #
  #  Note also that these timeouts are distinct from the SingleResolver's packet_timeout
  #
  #  Timeouts apply to the initial query and response. If DNSSEC validation is to
  #  be performed, then additional queries may be required (these are performed automatically
  #  by Dnsruby). Each additional query will be performed with its own timeouts.
  #  So, even with a query_timeout of 5 seconds, a response which required extensive
  #  validation may take several times that long.
  #  (Future versions of Dnsruby may expose finer-grained events for client tracking of
  #  responses and validation)
  #
  #  == Methods
  #
  #  === Synchronous
  #  These methods raise an exception or return a response message with rcode==NOERROR
  #
  #  *  Dnsruby::Resolver#send_message(msg)
  #  *  Dnsruby::Resolver#query(name [, type [, klass]])
  #
  #    There are "!" versions of these two methods that return an array [response, error]
  #    instead of raising an error on failure.  They can be called as follows:
  #
  #    response, error = resolver.send_message!(...)
  #    response, error = resolver.query!(...)
  #
  #    If the request succeeds, response will contain the Dnsruby::Message response
  #    and error will be nil.
  #
  #    If the request fails, response will be nil and error will contain the error raised.
  #
  #  === Asynchronous
  #  These methods use a response queue to return the response and the error
  #
  #  *  Dnsruby::Resolver#send_async(msg, response_queue, query_id)
  #
  #  == Event Loop
  #  Dnsruby runs a pure Ruby event loop to handle I/O in a single thread.
  #  Support for EventMachine has been deprecated.

    #  Asynchronously send a Message to the server. The send can be done using just
    #  Dnsruby. Support for EventMachine has been deprecated.
    #
    #  == Dnsruby pure Ruby event loop :
    #
    #  A client_queue is supplied by the client,
    #  along with an optional client_query_id to identify the response. The client_query_id
    #  is generated, if not supplied, and returned to the client.
    #  When the response is known,
    #  a tuple of (query_id, response_message, exception) will be added to the client_queue.
    #
    #  The query is sent synchronously in the caller's thread. The select thread is then used to
    #  listen for and process the response (up to pushing it to the client_queue). The client thread
    #  is then used to retrieve the response and deal with it.
    #
    #  Takes :
    #
    #  * msg - the message to send
    #  * client_queue - a Queue to push the response to, when it arrives
    #  * client_query_id - an optional ID to identify the query to the client
    #  * use_tcp - whether to use only TCP (defaults to SingleResolver.use_tcp)
    #
    #  Returns :
    #
    #  * client_query_id - to identify the query response to the client. This ID is
    #  generated if it is not passed in by the client
    #
    #  === Example invocations :
    #
    #     id = res.send_async(msg, queue)
