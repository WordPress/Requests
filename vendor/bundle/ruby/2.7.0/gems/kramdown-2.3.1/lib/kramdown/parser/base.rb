    # == \Base class for parsers
    #
    # This class serves as base class for parsers. It provides common methods that can/should be
    # used by all parsers, especially by those using StringScanner(Kramdown) for parsing.
    #
    # A parser object is used as a throw-away object, i.e. it is only used for storing the needed
    # state information during parsing. Therefore one can't instantiate a parser object directly but
    # only use the Base::parse method.
    #
    # == Implementing a parser
    #
    # Implementing a new parser is rather easy: just derive a new class from this class and put it
    # in the Kramdown::Parser module -- the latter is needed so that the auto-detection of the new
    # parser works correctly. Then you need to implement the +#parse+ method which has to contain
    # the parsing code.
    #
    # Have a look at the Base::parse, Base::new and Base#parse methods for additional information!
    class Base

      # The hash with the parsing options.
      attr_reader :options

      # The array with the parser warnings.
      attr_reader :warnings

      # The original source string.
      attr_reader :source

      # The root element of element tree that is created from the source string.
      attr_reader :root

      # Initialize the parser object with the +source+ string and the parsing +options+.
      #
      # The @root element, the @warnings array and @text_type (specifies the default type for newly
      # created text nodes) are automatically initialized.
      def initialize(source, options)
        @source = source
        @options = Kramdown::Options.merge(options)
        @root = Element.new(:root, nil, nil, encoding: (source.encoding rescue nil), location: 1,
                            options: {}, abbrev_defs: {}, abbrev_attr: {})

      # return the root element of the element tree and an array with warning messages.
