module Kramdown

  # Represents all elements in the element tree.
  #
  # kramdown only uses this one class for representing all available elements in an element tree
  # (paragraphs, headers, emphasis, ...). The type of element can be set via the #type accessor.
  #
  # The root of a kramdown element tree has to be an element of type :root. It needs to have certain
  # option keys set so that conversions work correctly. If only a part of a tree should be
  # converted, duplicate the root node and assign the #children appropriately, e.g:
  #
  #   root = doc.root
  #   new_root = root.dup
  #   new_root.children = [root.children[0]]  # assign new array with elements to convert
  #
  # Following is a description of all supported element types.
  #
  # Note that the option :location may contain the start line number of an element in the source
  # document.
  #

  #             parts of the kramdown document.

  #                definition.
  #
  # :abbrev_attr:: This key may be used to store the mapping of abbreviation to abbreviation
  #                attributes.
