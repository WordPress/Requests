If you haven't already, first see [TROUBLESHOOTING](https://github.com/guard/listen/blob/master/README.md#Issues-and-Troubleshooting) for known issues, solutions and workarounds.

You can report bugs and feature requests to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/guard/listen/issues).

**Please don't ask question in the issue tracker**, instead ask them in our

Try to figure out where the issue belongs to: Is it an issue with Listen itself or with Guard?


**It's most likely that your bug gets resolved faster if you provide as much information as possible!**

The MOST useful information is debugging output from Listen (`LISTEN_GEM_DEBUGGING=1`) - see [TROUBLESHOOTING](https://github.com/guard/listen/blob/master/README.md#Issues-and-Troubleshooting) for details.
